## Next Steps for Railway Deployment

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Railway**
   - Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Set environment variable: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - Deploy!

3. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check Railway dashboard for deployment status
   - Test all features on the deployed app
   - Monitor logs for any issues

## Key Changes Made

### home.py
- Updated to use `os.environ.get('PORT', 5000)` for Railway compatibility
- Maintains all existing functionality

### Procfile
- Simple configuration: `web: python home.py`
- Tells Railway how to run the Flask application

### Environment Variables
- Railway will automatically provide `PORT`
- You need to set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in Railway dashboard

### File Handling
- Uploads directory is properly configured
- Temporary file cleanup is maintained
- All static and template files are preserved

## Benefits of Railway Deployment

- âœ… **Automatic Deployments** - Deploy on every git push
- âœ… **Free Tier** - 500 hours/month free
- âœ… **Easy Scaling** - Upgrade when needed
- âœ… **Built-in HTTPS** - Secure by default
- âœ… **Global CDN** - Fast worldwide access
- âœ… **Simple Configuration** - Minimal setup required
